Immediate-

- Fix expansion locating
  Reduce search area to area within source & controller bounds
- Split scouting targets between each room's scouts
- Add Roads around built extension groups
- Have shuttleHarvesters build their own container when it gets created
- Add ramparts back into border walls 2W->1R sequence down a wall
- Ensure border walls have ramparts in the place where remote roads cross
- Ensure that fleeing Builders / Upgraders do not stand on reserved routes (Source, Controller, Remote)
- Fix haulers getting stuck when the storage appears
- Have remote harvesting manager handle walls blocking path to sources
- attempt at lower level to speed up debugging
- improved scout pathfinding

Mineral Director - Long Term
_ Add support to other Directors for spawning boosted creeps
_ Have code for Labs to handle making boosts available for fresh creeps

Defense Director - Long Term
_ Heal Masons + Defender creeps on / near Ramparts
Add combat mason creep
Find primaried ramparts, sit away from the rampart / wall to repair
_ Create Ramparts that will survive Nuke splash on important buildings (Spawns, Storage, Terminal)
_ Create Ramparts over upgrader
Periodically assess the tank of all enemy targets
Only attack with towers if the tank can be broken
_ Handle damage resistance, healing, volley damage and Creep body part placement in tanking calculations
Add Nuke marker detection

- Move buildings that are economical to move, out of the splash zone
  - Shield Expensive Buildings with ramparts - Storage, Terminal, Labs, Nuker, Factory, Power Spawn
- Reinforce ramparts on important buildings that cannot be moved
- Stop spawning new creeps into the room in a short period before the Nuke lands
  Spawn Defender melee creeps to push back attackers
  Spawn Repair Creeps to repair damage if attackers are attacking at range
  Handle response creep boosting
  Automatic Expansion to New rooms - Long Term (ISH)
  Add room flags to enable:
  Pushing controller levels (default on)
  Stockpiling energy
  Sending energy to other rooms (Terminal or Hauler)
  Sending workers to new rooms
  Claim target room with claimer
  Auto place spawn construction site
  Stop Ramparts appearing in wrong room
  Multi-Room Defense

CPU assesments per room
Check if CPU spare to expand to a new room
Write up an expansion mode that purely uses low numbers of very large creeps from neighboring room
